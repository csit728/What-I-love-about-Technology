# What-I-love-about-Technology
What I love about technology is that it has made the world feel a lot smaller. Technology allows us to connect with anyone, anywhere at anytime. I also love that technology is always changing. It's exciting to look at how much has changed with our everyday technology in the last 20 years, and to think about where it will be in the next 20 years. With all the division and conflict in today's world, I feel like technology is one thing that has the power to bring us all together.
